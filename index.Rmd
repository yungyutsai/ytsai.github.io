I am a doctoral candidate at the University of Missouri <a href = "https://truman.missouri.edu" target="_blank">Harry S Truman School of Government and Public Affairs</a>. 

My research interests lie in public policy, public finance, and social equity. In particular, my studies focus on three primary areas: (1) the effectiveness and equity of government funding and taxation, (2) finance and workforce management in the education and public sectors, and (3) the impact of tangible and intangible resources on socioeconomic outcomes. Some of my recent work focuses on the impact of taxing elite colleges on their spending and associated student outcomes, the impact of cash transfers on household decisions regarding fertility and investment in children's education, the influence of on-campus residence on college students' persistence and long-term academic and labor market results, and the effects of reassessing property to market values on housing prices and wealth distribution.

I obtained my MPA (Master in Public Administration) degree from National Chengchi University (Taiwan) in 2019 and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from National Taiwan University in 2015. Prior to starting my graduate degree, I worked in the Congress of Taiwan.
