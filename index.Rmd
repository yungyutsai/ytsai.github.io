I am a doctoral candidate at the University of Missouri <a href = "https://truman.missouri.edu" target="_blank">Harry S Truman School of Government and Public Affairs</a>. 

My research lies in the intersection of public finance and social equity, particular focuses on the policy area of education policy and taxation policy.
