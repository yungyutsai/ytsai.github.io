<font size=2> This study investigates the impact of teacher favoritism
(i.e., systematically favoring students of a specific gender, ethnicity,
or high previous class ranking) on teacher treatment and student
achievement. Based on the practice of random class grouping within
schools, a school fixed effect model is used to estimate the causal
effect of teacher favoritism. The results suggest that teacher
favoritism toward students with a higher previous class rank increases
the likelihood of these students consulting with their teacher on
academic, emotional, and friendship issues. Also, female students are
more likely to discuss friendships and emotional matters with pro-female
teachers. However, the evidence of teacher favoritism’s impact on
student achievement is relatively weak. </font size>

<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> Healthcare has been one of the most affected sectors
during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The utilization
of related services for non-COVID-19 diseases fell dramatically
following the point at which the virus broke out; however, little is
known about whether this observed decline in healthcare use was due to
voluntary behaviors or enforced measures. This paper quantifies the
spontaneous change in healthcare utilization during the pandemic. We
utilize a county-by-week-level dataset from Taiwan’s National Health
Insurance (NHI) record, covering the entire Taiwanese population, and a
difference-in-differences design. Our results indicate that even if
there were no human mobility restrictions or supply-side constraints,
people voluntarily reduced their demand for healthcare, due to fears of
contagion, or COVID-related precautionary behaviors. We find that the
number of outpatient visits (inpatient admissions) decreased by 19%
(10%) during the pandemic period (February to May 2020). Furthermore,
the demand response of healthcare for Influenza-like illness (ILI) was
much greater and more persistent than for non-ILI, thereby suggesting
that the substantial decline in accessing healthcare was induced by
positive public health externality of prevention measures for COVID-19.
Finally, we find that the demand for healthcare services did not get
back to the pre-pandemic baseline, even when there were no local
coronavirus cases for 253 consecutive days (mid-April to December 2020)
in Taiwan. </font size>

<font size=2> The arm’s length principle implies that intermediary

government or politicians. This paper uses data from the art funding
list from 2015 to 2017 in Taiwan to examine whether The National Culture
and Arts Foundation (NCAF, an intermediary cultural organization)
distributes funding fairer than The Ministry of Culture (MOC). There are
three different concepts of fairness: equity, equality, and need
(distributing funding to those who need it). The result of this paper
shows MOC and NCAF have no significant difference in equity, but NCAF
indeed performs better on equality and need than MOC, although the
effect isn’t as strong as we thought. Based on these findings, this
paper suggests that the arm’s length principle really works, and it’s
necessary for MOC to collaborate with NCAF. However, it’s also important
to improve the fairness of art funding allocation in the future.

<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> US higher education is witnessing rapid changes in the
racial demographics of student and faculty populations. While racial
representation on American campuses is increasing, faculty diversity
lags behind student diversity regarding race and ethnicity. Using data
from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) from
2001 to 2021, this study captures the racial dynamics of student and
faculty populations in different higher education institution types. The
paper, then, applies the concept of stock-and-flow to study the
contributions of diversity inflow (faculty hiring) and diversity outflow
(faculty turnover) on faculty diversity stock. Five simulations are
constructed to predict faculty diversity changes and future trends
sector-wide. Our policy recommendation calls for balanced efforts in
both the retention and hiring of faculty to diversify the faculty
workforce. </font size>

<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> Utilizing administrative data encompassing the entire

effects of job displacement on earnings and mental health. Focusing on
job loss resulting from mass layoffs, our estimates suggest displaced
workers experienced a 67% earning loss in the year following a layoff.
Even after ten years, earnings do not fully recover. Displaced workers
also experience long term deterioration in mental health, particularly
related to stress, with a 16% increase in cumulative outpatient visits
for mental health issues and a 57% increase in cumulative medical costs
for mental illness in the decade post-displacement. The negative impact
on mental health is more pronounced among workers with lower earnings,

<font size=2> This paper utilizes wealth shocks from winning lottery
prizes to examine the causal effect of financial resources on fertility.
We utilize extensive panels of administrative data encompassing over 0.4
million lottery winners in Taiwan and implement a triple-differences
design. Our analyses reveal that a substantial lottery win can
significantly increase fertility and the implied wealth elasticity of
fertility is around 0.06. Moreover, the primary channel through which
fertility increases is by prompting first births among previously
childless individuals. Finally, our analysis reveals approximately 33%
of the total fertility effect stems from increased marriage rates
following lottery wins. </font size>

income tax—Evidence from the Tax Cut and Job Act.
<details>
<summary>
<font size=2>Abstract</font size>
</summary>
<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> A select few non-profit colleges in the US have managed
enormous endowments that annually generate considerable capital gains,
which were historically exempted from taxation. In the 2017 Tax Cut and
Job Act, the government imposed a new net investment income tax on large
and wealthy non-profit colleges. The policy aims to improve tax equity
and wealth distribution across higher education institutions. However,
as the policy has a tax threshold based on student population, this
paper finds that colleges manipulate student enrollment to avoid the
tax. Besides, colleges subject to the tax respond to the tax cost by
increasing the tuition level to shift the burden to their customers
(students). This paper finds that colleges’ behavioral and fiscal
responses further reduce the college enrollment of students of
historically underrepresented racial groups. The result implies that the
net investment income tax aiming to improve tax equity might
unintentionally impede equity in access to higher education.

values—Decompose the capitalization and anchoring effects.
<details>
<summary>
<font size=2>Abstract</font size>
</summary>
<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> Property reassessments aim to align property’s assessed
values with market prices, serving as an essential tool to ensure tax
fairness. However, reassessments can unintentionally impact housing
values and, therefore, affect wealth distribution. Based on data from 19
Pennsylvania counties, this study examines property reassessment’s
impact on housing values. The paper explores two contrasting theories:
the capitalization effect, which predicts reduced housing values in
wealthy regions and increased prices in less developed areas, and the
anchoring effect, anticipating more pronounced price increases in
affluent regions and wider disparities in housing prices. Using a
difference-in-differences approach and instrumental variable analysis,
the study finds the anchoring effect dominates. On average, property
reassessment raises housing values by 9% in counties, with a pronounced
positive effect in high-priced regions and a negative impact in
non-affluent regions. This highlights that while reassessment enhances
tax fairness, it also disproportionately benefits wealthier individuals
and widens geographical disparity in housing prices, contradicting
wealth equality goals. </font size>

<font size=2>Abstract</font size>
</summary>
<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> This study investigates the influence of residing in
student dormitories on short and long-term student outcomes within the
context of Taiwan. This research examines the causal effects of
on-campus residency by utilizing colleges’ dormitory assignment policy
based on students’ residential locations and employing a boundary-based
regression discontinuity design. The study incorporates a two-way fixed
effect model, including both college and village fixed effects, to
account for potential geographical self-selection biases. The findings
reveal that on-campus living doesn’t significantly impact persistence,
but it does enhance the likelihood of pursuing graduate education,
primarily influenced by enrolling in the same college for undergraduate
studies. This positive effect can be attributed to two intermediate
outcomes: an increase in on-campus employment, indicative of greater
on-campus engagement, and a higher likelihood of receiving awards from
contests or competitions, suggesting increased participation in
extracurricular activities. The impact is more pronounced among students
from low-income families, those without siblings, and those attending
more prestigious colleges. </font size>

<details>

<font size=2>Abstract</font size>
</summary>
<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> This study examines the impact of a Taiwanese upper
secondary admission reform, which reduces the level of tracking without
abandoning the general/vocational dual-track system. I utilize a
difference-in-differences framework, comparing the difference of high
school (exposed to the reform) and middle school (non-exposed to the
reform) students before and after the reform. The results suggest that
the reform raises the within-school student heterogeneity by around half
the gap between full tracking and non-tracking system. Furthermore, the
de-tracking reform leads to a 0.148 standard deviation drop in average
student performance. The de-tracking policy yields an evenly negative
impact throughout the whole distribution, implying that the efficiency
gained from the tracking does not at the cost of equity. </font size>

representativeness and colleague demographic similarity on public
employees’ work-related attitude.
<details>
<summary>
<font size=2>Abstract</font size>
</summary>
<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> Racial composition and diversity management in public
sectors has long been an important topic in public management
literature. Past research has confirmed that supervisor
representativeness can benefit government employees, yet little
attention has been paid to the well-being of supervisors and the
consequences that neglecting that well-being may cause. Utilizing the
federal employee surveys and the Federal Government’s human resources
data, we apply the multilevel modeling (MLM) approach to examine the
impact of management racial representativeness and colleague racial
demographic similarities on public employees’ job satisfaction and
turnover intention. We find that the impact of management
representativeness is exerted primarily through the perceived diversity
climate. A higher proportion of same-race colleagues also leads to
better work-related attitudes. Co-worker relationships and perceived
diversity climate both mediate the impacts. However, we find that while
a higher proportion of same-race subordinates improves the satisfaction
of supervisors who are the dominant racial group in their work unit, it
negatively affects the supervisors who are not the dominant racial group
in their work unit. Studies need to focus not only on how the
representation of supervisors benefits subordinates but also, and indeed
more so, on supervisor well-being. Based on these findings, we make
recommendations for diversity management strategies in the public
sector. </font size>
