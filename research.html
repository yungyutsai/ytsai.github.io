<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> U.S. higher education institutions are hiring more
minoritized faculty into their teaching workforce to satisfy the demand
of an increasingly diverse racial and ethnic student population.
However, it is not always clear whether specific hiring policies and
plans are intended to address the matter of diversity or
representation—two similar but qualitatively different concepts. The
policy choices that institutions make result in different implementation
approaches and long-term outcomes. Using data from the Integrated
Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) from 2001 to 2021, this
study measures and compares the changes in faculty diversity and
student–faculty representation in U.S. higher education institutions
over the past two decades. It then develops several simulated scenarios
to project the future racial and ethnic landscape of American campuses,
depending on the different policy choices that institutions make through
their hiring and retention policies. Our recommendation calls for
balanced efforts in the retention and hiring of minoritized and
underrepresented faculty that are adapted to the individual
circumstances of institutions. </font size>

<font size=2> Utilizing administrative data encompassing the entire
population of Taiwan, this paper investigates the long-term effects of
job displacement on earnings and mental health. Focusing on job loss
resulting from mass layoffs and plant closures, our estimates suggest
displaced workers experienced a 67–68% earning loss in the year
following a layoff. Even after ten years, earnings do not fully recover.
Displaced workers also experience long-term deterioration in mental
health, particularly related to stress, with a 15–16% increase in
cumulative outpatient visits for mental health issues and a 57–62%
increase in cumulative medical costs for mental illness in the decade
post-displacement. The negative impact on mental health is more
pronounced among workers with lower earnings, men, and older
individuals. </font size>

<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> This study investigates the impact of teacher favoritism
(i.e., systematically favoring students of a specific gender, ethnicity,
or high previous class ranking) on teacher treatment and student
achievement. Based on the practice of random class grouping within
schools, a school fixed effect model is used to estimate the causal
effect of teacher favoritism. The results suggest that teacher
favoritism toward students with a higher previous class rank increases
the likelihood of these students consulting with their teacher on
academic, emotional, and friendship issues. Also, female students are
more likely to discuss friendships and emotional matters with pro-female
teachers. However, the evidence of teacher favoritism’s impact on
student achievement is relatively weak. </font size>

<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> Healthcare has been one of the most affected sectors
during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The utilization
of related services for non-COVID-19 diseases fell dramatically
following the point at which the virus broke out; however, little is
known about whether this observed decline in healthcare use was due to
voluntary behaviors or enforced measures. This paper quantifies the
spontaneous change in healthcare utilization during the pandemic. We
utilize a county-by-week-level dataset from Taiwan’s National Health
Insurance (NHI) record, covering the entire Taiwanese population, and a
difference-in-differences design. Our results indicate that even if
there were no human mobility restrictions or supply-side constraints,
people voluntarily reduced their demand for healthcare, due to fears of
contagion, or COVID-related precautionary behaviors. We find that the
number of outpatient visits (inpatient admissions) decreased by 19%
(10%) during the pandemic period (February to May 2020). Furthermore,
the demand response of healthcare for Influenza-like illness (ILI) was
much greater and more persistent than for non-ILI, thereby suggesting
that the substantial decline in accessing healthcare was induced by
positive public health externality of prevention measures for COVID-19.
Finally, we find that the demand for healthcare services did not get
back to the pre-pandemic baseline, even when there were no local
coronavirus cases for 253 consecutive days (mid-April to December 2020)
in Taiwan. </font size>

This paper uses data from the art funding list from 2015 to 2017 in Taiwan to examine whether The National Culture and Arts Foundation (NCAF, an intermediary cultural organization) distributes funding fairer than The Ministry of Culture (MOC). There are three different concepts of fairness: equity, equality, and need (distributing funding to those who need it). The result of this paper shows MOC and NCAF have no significant difference in equity, but NCAF indeed performs better on equality and need than MOC, although the effect isn’t as strong as we thought. Based on these findings, this paper suggests that the arm’s length principle really works, and it’s necessary for MOC to collaborate with NCAF. However, it’s also important to improve the fairness of art funding allocation in the future. </font size></div>

We employ extensive panels of administrative data encompassing over 0.4
million lottery winners in Taiwan and implement a triple-differences
design. Our analyses reveal that a substantial lottery win can
significantly increase fertility, the implied wealth elasticity of which
is around 0.06. Moreover, the primary channel through which fertility
increases is by prompting first births among previously childless
individuals. Finally, our analysis reveals that approximately 25% of the
total fertility effect stems from increased marriage rates following a

<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> The government has been investing efforts in improving its
workforce diversity. Past research on representative bureaucracy has
confirmed that increased diversity at both the leadership and lower
levels can benefit the public (Riccucci &amp; Van Ryzin, 2017). However,
the representation of people of color at the leadership level remains
scarce, which can create challenges for leaders from under-represented
groups. Leaders from under-represented groups might feel pressures and
challenges from tokenism and increased demands and expectations of
under-represented subordinates (Kanter, 1977a and 1977b). Utilizing
federal employee surveys and the Federal Government’s human resources
data, we examine the impact of having more same-race subordinates on
supervisors’ job satisfaction and turnover intention using a two-way
fixed effects model. The findings suggest that while having more
subordinates from similar demographic backgrounds benefits White
supervisors, it burdens supervisors of color, leading to a decrease in
their job satisfaction and an increase in turnover intention. This
negative consequence is mitigated as minority supervisors obtain a
higher share in their agency and reverse positively when they occupy
more than 35% of the leadership level. Using a product-of-coefficient
method, we find that role clarity and supervisor relationships mediate
these effects. These results imply that having more same-race
subordinates puts managers of color into conflicts between
organizational norms and the expectations of their own community.

prices—Trade-offs between tax fairness and housing equity.
<details>
<summary>
<font size=2>Abstract</font size>
</summary>
<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> Property reassessments aim to align property’s assessed
values with market prices, serving as an essential tool to ensure tax
fairness. However, reassessments can unintentionally impact housing
values and, therefore, affect wealth distribution. Based on data from 19
Pennsylvania counties, this study examines property reassessment’s
impact on housing values. The paper explores two contrasting theories:
the capitalization effect, which predicts reduced housing values in
wealthy regions and increased prices in less developed areas, and the
anchoring effect, anticipating more pronounced price increases in
affluent regions and wider disparities in housing prices. Using a
difference-in-differences approach and instrumental variable analysis,
the study finds the anchoring effect dominates. On average, property
reassessment raises housing values by 9% in counties, with a pronounced
positive effect in high-priced regions and a negative impact in
non-affluent regions. This highlights that while reassessment enhances
tax fairness, it also disproportionately benefits wealthier individuals
and widens geographical disparity in housing prices, contradicting
wealth equality goals. </font size>

<font size=2>Abstract</font size>
</summary>
<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> This study investigates the influence of residing in
student dormitories on short and long-term student outcomes within the
context of Taiwan. This research examines the causal effects of
on-campus residency by utilizing colleges’ dormitory assignment policy
based on students’ residential locations and employing a boundary-based
regression discontinuity design. The study incorporates a two-way fixed
effect model, including both college and village fixed effects, to
account for potential geographical self-selection biases. The findings
reveal that on-campus living doesn’t significantly impact persistence,
but it does enhance the likelihood of pursuing graduate education,
primarily influenced by enrolling in the same college for undergraduate
studies. This positive effect can be attributed to two intermediate
outcomes: an increase in on-campus employment, indicative of greater
on-campus engagement, and a higher likelihood of receiving awards from
contests or competitions, suggesting increased participation in
extracurricular activities. The impact is more pronounced among students
from low-income families, those without siblings, and those attending
more prestigious colleges. </font size>

<li>Tsai, Yung-Yu. The impact of tracking on student achievement and
achievement gap—Evidence from admission reform in Taiwan
<details>
<summary>
<font size=2>Abstract</font size>
</summary>
<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> This study examines the impact of a Taiwanese upper
secondary admission reform, which reduces the level of tracking without
abandoning the general/vocational dual-track system. I utilize a
difference-in-differences framework, comparing the difference of high
school (exposed to the reform) and middle school (non-exposed to the
reform) students before and after the reform. The results suggest that
the reform raises the within-school student heterogeneity by around half
the gap between full tracking and non-tracking system. Furthermore, the
de-tracking reform leads to a 0.148 standard deviation drop in average
student performance. The de-tracking policy yields an evenly negative
impact throughout the whole distribution, implying that the efficiency
gained from the tracking does not at the cost of equity. </font size>

<li>Hung, Wan-Ju &amp; Tsai, Yung-Yu. Reducing administrative burden on
disadvantaged vendors in government outsourcing: The role of request for
proposal duration
<details>
<summary>
<font size=2>Abstract</font size>
</summary>
<blockquote>
<div style="line-height:100%;">
<font size=2> Governments have increasingly focused on enhancing equity
and diversity in contracting. We apply administrative burden theory to
government contracting, investigating ways for government to increase
vendor diversity. Drawing on insights from administrative burden theory,
we expect that longer request for proposal (RFP) duration allows
disadvantaged vendors more time to navigate application complexities
and, therefore, increase their participation and likelihood of winning
contracts. We analyze data from Taiwan’s Government Procurement System,
covering 150,000 contracts from January 2023 to June 2024, with a focus
on Disability Employment Organizations, Women’s Welfare Organizations,
and Indigenous Rights Organizations. We employ a fixed-effects model to
control for agency-specific and product/service-specific factors,
investigating the relationship between RFP duration and
participation/bidding outcome of disadvantaged vendors. Results show
each additional RFP day increases the participation of Disability
Employment Organizations, Women’s Welfare Organizations, and Indigenous
Rights Organizations by 6%, 25%, and 8%, respectively. Moreover, each
extra day increases the likelihood of Disability Employment
Organizations and Women’s Welfare Organizations winning bids by 8% and
15%, respectively. Our findings provide evidence that extending proposal
submission windows can enhance diversity and equity in government
contracting. </font size>
